# Overview ‚úÖ

`{qcthat}` is a quality control framework for R packages used in Clinical Trials. It has been adopted from the qualification framework used in [`{gsm}`](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm).

The benefit of using `{qcthat}` is that you are given a basic scaffold to build out a qualification testing strategy for your R package. This includes:

  - A qualification testing folder that lives inside of your `/tests` folder; designed to use with [`{testthat}`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/).
  - A basic `.Rmd` report that displays the results of qualification tests.
  - A `.github/workflows` folder that includes a templated YAML file, which will automate the creation of a qualification report for every new release of your R package. This can be easily customized to fit your needs.

`{qcthat}` is a quality control framework for R packages. It has been
developed for use in the `gsm` family of packages, such as
[`gsm.core`](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.core).

The goal of `{qcthat}` is to produce qualification reports linking
GitHub issues to evidence that those issues have been implemented. These
reports can be used as part of a quality control and acceptance process
for R packages, particularly those used in regulated environments such
as clinical trials.

## ⚙️ Installation

You can install the latest release of qcthat from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Gilead-BioStats/qcthat@*release")
```

<div class="pkgdown-devel">

You can install the development version of qcthat from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Gilead-BioStats/qcthat")
```

## 📋 Example Report Process

`Action_qcthat()` installs a GitHub action to generate QC reports. At
its core, it uses the functions `QCPackage()`, `QCPR()`,
`QCCompletedIssues()`, and `QCMilestones()` to generate a report like
this:

## 🙋 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Creating a utility package that is
generalizable and extensible to all sorts of repository structures is
challenging, and your input is greatly appreciated.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to file an
[issue](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/qcthat/issues), which should
generally fall under one of the following categories:

- Bugfix: something is broken.
- Feature: something is wanted or needed.
- QC: documentation or metadata is incorrect or missing.

New code should generally follow the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

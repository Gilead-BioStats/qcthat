# {qcthat} ✅

[qcthat](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/) is a quality control
framework for R packages, particularly those used in Clinical Trials. It
is being adapted from the qualification framework used in the `gsm`
family of packages, such as
[`{gsm.core}`](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.core) and
[`{gsm.app}`](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.app).

The goal of [qcthat](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/) is to
provide a qualification report linking GitHub issues to evidence that
those issues have been implemented. This report can be used as part of a
quality control and acceptance process for R packages, particularly
those used in regulated environments such as clinical trials.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

You can install the development version of
[qcthat](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/) from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Gilead-BioStats/qcthat")
```

To utilize [qcthat](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/), you must

1.  Use GitHub Issues to document requirements (see [Chapter 20:
    Software development practices from *R Packages (2e)* by Hadley
    Wickham and Jennifer
    Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/software-development-practices.html)).
2.  Use {testthat} to verify the implementation of those requirements
    (see the [Testing section of *R Packages (2e)* by Hadley Wickham and
    Jennifer Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html)).
3.  Link tests to issues by including `#{issue_number}` in the test
    description, such as:

``` r
test_that("Users can view a matrix of GitHub issues and test results (#31)", {
  # Expectations that prove that this worked.
})
```

## 📋 Example Report Process

A sample [GitHub Action to generate a report is included in this
repository](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/qcthat/blob/dev/.github/workflows/qcthis.yaml)
(coming soon to the package itself). This is the process that it
follows:

### Capture {testthat} test results

Run the local testthat tests with `stop_on_failure = FALSE`, and assign
the result to a variable. We use the “silent” reporter to avoid
unnecessary output.

``` r
lTestResults <- testthat::test_local(
  stop_on_failure = FALSE,
  reporter = "silent"
)
```

The resulting object is a list with class `"testthat_results"`. {qcthat}
parses that object to link test results to issues.

### Generate Issue-Test Matrix

Use
[`qcthat::FetchRepoIssues()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/dev/reference/FetchRepoIssues.md)
to get the issues for the repository connected to the active project,
and compile the test results with
[`qcthat::CompileTestResults()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/dev/reference/CompileTestResults.md).
Together these data frames are used by
[`qcthat::CompileIssueTestMatrix()`](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/dev/reference/CompileIssueTestMatrix.md)
to create a nested tibble with class `"qcthat_IssueTestMatrix"` which
links issues to tests. Printing the `"qcthat_IssueTestMatrix"` object
produces a human-readable summary of the results.

``` r
IssueTestMatrix <- qcthat::CompileIssueTestMatrix(
  dfRepoIssues = qcthat::FetchRepoIssues(),
  dfTestResults = qcthat::CompileTestResults(lTestResults)
)
print(IssueTestMatrix)
```

For example, this is the output for a recent report for this {qcthat}
repository (issues nested under milestones other than v0.2.0 have been
removed).

``` R

## 📄 Example Business Process

Here we describe a business process for implementing quality control
using [qcthat](https://gilead-biostats.github.io/qcthat/). This process
is intended to ensure that program development, testing, review, and
acceptance are conducted in a structured manner. Additional (optional)
configuration details for each core step are described in the following
sections.

### Roles

- 👑 or TL: Team Lead
- 🧑‍💻 or PD: Program Developer
- 🧪 or QCP: Quality Control Programmer
- 💼 or USR: User or Requester
- 🤖 or AUTO: Automated System

### Overview

1.  **🧑‍💻 File Issues:** Program developer documents feature/programming
    requirements using Github Issues.
2.  **🧑‍💻 Write Code:** Program developer updates code and associated
    documentation in R package.
3.  **🧪 Write Tests:** Quality Control Programmer writes needed tests
    and includes a link to the issue by including `(#{issue_number})` in
    the test description.
4.  **🤖 Release Package:** Upon a GitHub release, all tests are
    automatically run and a summary report linking issues with
    associated tests is created and attached to the release.

### Intake 🧑‍💻💼

- 🧑‍💻💼: PD receives feature/programming request from USR.
- 🧑‍💻💼: PD documents feature/programming request from USR using Github
  Issues.
- 🧑‍💻: PD creates an issue for each Business Requirement.
- 🧑‍💻: PD creates and links separate issues or sub-issues to document
  technical requirements and implementation details for each business
  requirement.

### Code Development 🧑‍💻👑🧪💼

- 🧑‍💻: PD develops or modifies program using the user requirements.
- 👑🧑‍💻🧪💼: All stakeholders (PD, TL, QCP and USR) add comments and
  reactions on the issue to finalize scope as needed.
- 👑💼: USR and/or TL documents approval of business requirements via
  comment or a “thumbs up” reaction as needed.
- 🧑‍💻: PD provides clear description of changes with every commit
  comment. If developer chooses to provide a message addressing a
  specific change, the commit comment should be a descriptive, concise,
  single-line summary of the change. If more context is needed, PD
  should add a comment to an issue in GitHub.

### Testing 🧑‍💻🧪

- 🧑‍💻🧪🤖: Where applicable, QCP or PD defines an automated test for
  every applicable user requirement to demonstrate that the information
  displayed by the report/application is fit for purpose and meets the
  stated requirement. Testing is performed by using common frameworks
  {testthat} and {shinytest2} depending on the development process.
  Tests are linked to the corresponding business requirements with
  “(#{issue_number})” in the description.
- 🧑‍💻🧪🤖: Testing strategy for each requirement is documented by
  updating the Business Requirement GitHub issues or by referencing the
  issue number in the commit message for test code. Testing is executed
  via automated services (such as GitHub Actions).

### Code Review 🧑‍💻🧪

- 🧑‍💻: Upon completion of code development and testing, the PD initiates
  a Pull Request (PR). All relevant issues and tests are linked to the
  PR.
- 🧪: QCP determines appropriate level of review. Verifies the code
  and/or output against the user requirements and documents the method
  and results.
- 🧑‍💻🧪: All questions and necessary code adjustments are addressed in
  the process of code review.

### QC and Acceptance 👑🧪

- 👑: Once the PD has addressed all required feedback, the TL conducts a
  final review of the code changes and documentation. TL verifies that
  all tests have passed, the website is successfully deployed (if
  applicable), and the release pull request (PR) correctly targets the
  primary branch.
- 👑🧪: When the qualification of the program is completed, QCP confirms
  and documents the result and acceptance. Final acceptance of the
  utility program or interactive report is documented by the TL or QCP
  through formal approval of the Pull Request (PR) within the SCM
  system. Once the request is approved, the finalized code is merged
  into the main code base and ready for release.

### Release 🧑‍💻🧪

- Upon acceptance, the PD or QCP creates a formal release in accordance
  with established version control conventions. This serves as
  documentation and as an equivalent of program deployment into a
  production environment.

## 🙋 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Creating a utility package that is
generalizable and extensible to all sorts of repository structures is
challenging, and your input is greatly appreciated.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to file an
[issue](https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/qcthat/issues), which should
generally fall under one of the following categories:

- Bugfix: something is broken.
- Feature: something is wanted or needed.
- QC: documentation or metadata is incorrect or missing.

New code should generally follow the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
